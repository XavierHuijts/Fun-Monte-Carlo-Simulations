# Fun-Monte-Carlo-Simulations

This repository is mainly for me to practise Java. 
In here I upload examples of several monte carlo simulations to proof the existance of common probabilistic misconcepts. For example:
- That each spin in roulete is independent from previous spins. The contrary is also  called 'Gamblers Fallacy'
- The 'Birtday paradox', which shows the (unintuitive) large probability of overlapping birtdays of students in a class.
